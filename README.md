# Academic Projects Repository  

Welcome to my **Academic Projects Repository**, where I organize and showcase the projects completed during my **Data Science program** at the **University of New Haven**. Each project demonstrates the application of concepts and skills learned in different subjects, providing insights into my journey as a data science enthusiast.  

## Purpose  

This repository serves as:  
- A centralized location for all academic projects.  
- A showcase of subject-specific skills and expertise.  
- A reflection of my learning process and technical growth.  

## Repository Structure  

The repository is organized into folders for each subject:
